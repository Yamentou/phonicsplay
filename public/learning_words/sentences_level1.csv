The cat sat on the mat with a hat.
We can ride the bike on a wide side road.
The pig is big and likes to dig.
Look at the tree with the bee and see.
The dog found a log in the fog.
I like to eat cake by the lake.
The rat ran fast with the bat.
Put the mug on the rug near the bug.
The sun is fun when we run.
The red hen met ten men.
Tap the map to find the gap.
The hot pot is on top of the mop.
I hope to cope with the slope of the rope.
The fan can pan for gold in the van.
A ripe fig is big on the twig.
The ship will dip its fin in the sea.
Hop on the rock and pop the top.
The tune of June makes me smile a mile.
Cut the nut and put it in the hut.
The kite takes flight in the night light.
The goat in a coat sits in a boat.
Sip tea and dip the sweet treat.
The train is late in the rain.
Peek at the week on the sheet.
Hug the jug and tug the rug.
